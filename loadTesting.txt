Objective:
Load testing can be done using multiple tools like JMeter, Gatling, apache benchmark etc.. Here i have chosen 'AB'. 

Approach:
Setup Isolated environment for testing and perform API under test with multiple different loads to estimate the optimal load that server can withstand.
What that metrics we can improve the infra capabilities & also find out any application issue like memory leak etc..

Example command to perform the tests:
n= number of requests
c= concurrency of requests

ab -n 6 -c 2 "<URL to be tested>"
